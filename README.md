# AISecretary

AISecretary is a collection of MCP servers designed to automate the tasks of a virtual secretary insede the Outlook suite. Each server handles a specific tool, such as:
- Outlook Mail
- Outlook Calendar
- Outlook Contacts
- Outlook Mailbox Settings
- Categories

## Features

- **Modular:** Each tool runs as an independent server, so you can start only the ones you need.
- **Easy integration:** Compatible with OpenWebUI and other platforms supporting MCP.
- **Extensible:** Easily add new servers for additional tools or services.
- **Automation:** Handles repetitive tasks like checking emails, managing calendars, and more.

## Prerequisites

- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed (Python environment and dependency manager).
- Python 3.11 or higher.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to configure and run the server:

### Service Setup

To configure the necessary Microsoft Graph API settings, follow this setup guide:

- [Outlook](setups/Microsoft.md)

---

### Running the Server

Run the following command to start the server (replace `server.py` with your actual server file):

#### Recommended: Using Claude Desktop

If you have Claude Desktop installed:

```bash
uv run mcp install server.py
```

Other option to install your server in Claude Desktop is to edit the configuration file at:
`C:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```config
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Server_name": {
      "command": "/Your/path/to/uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "--with",
        "msal",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/your/path/to/server.py"
      ]
    },
  }
}
```

If you want all the MCP servers you can just also run the script `src/claude_setup.py`.

#### Alternative: Running with OpenWebUI

If you're using platforms like OpenWebUI:

```bash
uvx mcpo --port 9000 -- uv run mcp run server.py
```

Then open **OpenWebUI**, go to:

```
Settings > Tools > [+]
```

Add the following URL:

```
http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

You can now interact with **AISecretary** through the OpenWebUI interface.
