## .env Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your projectâ€™s `src/` directory with the following content:

```env
# Microsoft Graph API Configuration
CLIENT_ID=your_application_client_id
TENANT_ID=common
SCOPES=User.Read,Mail.Read,Mail.Send
TOKEN_CACHE_FILE=token_cache_microsoft.json
```

**Notes:**
- Replace `your_application_client_id` with the *Application (client) ID* from the Azure portal.
- The `TENANT_ID=common` setting allows both work and personal accounts. You can also use your specific tenant ID if needed.
- The `SCOPES` define the Graph API access the app will request.
